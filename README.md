# About
I am intersted in writing CLI tools in python, so I write this demo. I will be very happy if anyone benefit from it.

# Attention
 - This is just a demo for learning how to write CLI tools in python, not a project to solve specific problems.
 - I use trash-cli tool in clean.sh, I recommend it strongly as a substitution to *rm*, if you are working on linux distribution.

# Usage

You can see the shell *install.sh* scripts for more information. I wrote them for convenience. BTW, installation is very easy, just code

```
python setup.py install
```

Add sudo if permission denied.
