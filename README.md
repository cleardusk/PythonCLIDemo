# About
I am intersted in writing CLI tools in python, so I write this demo. I will be very happy if anyone benefit from it.

# Attention
This is just a demo for learning how to write CLI tools in python, not a project to solve specific problems.

# Usage

You can see the shell scripts for more information. I wrote them for convenience. BTW, installation is very easy, just code

```
python setup.py install
```

Add sudo if permission denied.
